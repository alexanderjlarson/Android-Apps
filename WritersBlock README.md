Writers Block Android App

This was a final project for my Mobile Apps class that I worked on and completed with a partner in class.

The objective of this project was to just create a fully functional app of our own choice for an android device.

This is a simple app that trys to help someone who is currently struggling with writers block by giving them little activities to try and get them out of it.
